# Paradigne

This repository encompasses all required files for the Paradigne New Dawn server.

MC Version: 1.6.4
Forge Version: 1.6.4-9.11.1.953-universal
Modpack/Server Version: 2.5.2
MCPC+ Version: git-MCPC-Plus-Jenkins-Cauldron-164-272 (API Version: 1.6.4 R2.1)
Modpack Information: http://www.technicpack.net/modpack/paradignepack.182438

Please Note:
1) The server must be used in conjunction with the custom modpack, the ParadignePack.
2) Server files and ModPack files are not universal, and the modpack is not intended to be utilized without the server.
3) Basic knowledge of how a server functions and is run is required to work with this.
4) Craftbukkit is not being used for this version. Most server hosts do not support MCPC+, so target the included "craftbukkit" file instead.
